title: Selected for GSoC'18
---

I am selected for GSoC'18 under The Honeynet Organization. This is my second and last attempt at GSoC.
The major task to be tackled in this project is to increase the code coverage of android testing tool [DroidBot](https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot/) using AI. Currently droidbot performs black box testing using the GUI elements. So I have focussed on improving only black box testing methods without assuming access to any previous data/information regarding the code structure using machine learning algorithms that are mentioned in the proposal. Using them, I will be trying to increase the code coverage of the GUI based testing system of DroidBot.
